# NL2SQL for MIMIC-4 Database

A research project exploring advanced Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) techniques for querying the MIMIC-IV database.

## Project Overview

This project investigates and implements various approaches to convert natural language queries into SQL for medical database interactions. The focus is on achieving high accuracy and reliability in medical data retrieval through:

- Advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Fine-tuning of Large Language Models
- Ensemble methods
- Medical domain-specific optimizations
