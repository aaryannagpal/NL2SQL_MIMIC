It does this by selecting the lab_test column from the patient Lab_test table, where patient_id is 10021118 and encounter_id is the encounter_id of the first encounter for that patient.

We can achieve this by using a subquery to find the first encounter_id for the patient, and then using that value in the main query to select the lab_test column.
